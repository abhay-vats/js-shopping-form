# Shopping Form

A simple yet powerful-for-its-size shopping form built with vanilla JavaScript.

Things I learned while building this:

- How to build a simple reactive system that has a state,
- Event delegation and Custom Events
- Usage of aria-label and .matches(),
- Usage of Local Storage,
- And, finally, how to put everything together while having fun!
